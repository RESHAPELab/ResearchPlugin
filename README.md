# ResearchPlugin

Chrome extension to add tooltips on GitHub pages when creating pull requests, or creating an issue repoort in any repository to help newcomers contribute to open source projects.

This extension is written in Javascript, and uses the GitHub API to mine data about a user in JSON format to display the user's skill set on their profile page.
